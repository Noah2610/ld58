> What is happening to me?

You took a funny looking pill and now there are creatures chasing you.  
Luckily you have your little red cannon on you. It's bullet is designed to be re-usable, which is good because you only have one shot. Try not to lose it.

As usual, we worked on actual game content way too close to the deadline, so we didn't have time to thoroughly playtest and tweak the game. It's playable at least. Hopefully ü§∑  
We'll release a v1.0.1 post-jam version soon to improve the core gameplay.
