# Rough Plan
## Day 1
Priority: __Brainstorm game ideas!__  
Get a bevy app up and running, preferably with a couple idea-related features already.

## Day 2

Keep sprite assets bland / single-colored for development.  
__No fine-tuning!__ Just get a working game going.

## Day 3
Priority: __Have a playable game!__  
Assets, game values fine-tuning, __playtesting__!  
Write a nice README.
