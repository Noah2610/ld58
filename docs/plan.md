# Rough Plan
## Day 1
Priority: __Brainstorm game ideas!__ Theme: __Collector__  
Get a bevy app up and running, preferably with a couple idea-related features already.

### Progress - Day 1
- ~~game idea: __Losing My Marbles__~~
- new idea: __2d Heavy Bullets__

## Day 2
Priority: __Implement core game loop!__  
Keep sprite assets bland / single-colored for development.  
__No fine-tuning!__ Just get a working game going.

## Day 3
Priority: __Have a playable game!__  
Assets, game values fine-tuning, __playtesting__!  
Write a nice README.  
Build and publish game.
