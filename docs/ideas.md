# Game Concept Ideas
## Losing My Marbles
### Story
You are a happy, child-like creature, frolicking around a
"Happy Fun Land". Along your journey you find colorful marbles to collect,
and funny-tasting candy to eat.
After collecting enough marbles, you slowly start to realize that this
WORLD isn't "happy" and "fun", instead you're either:
- a mental patient in a clinic, or
- a test subject part of a inhumane experimentation facility

The marbles turn out to be your missing brain/body pieces.
The candy turns out to be medication / pills.

### Game Style
- 2d side-scrolling platformer

### Visual Style
"__Happy Fun Land__": Colorful child-like world,
visible while missing enough marbles or sedated through "candy".  

"__Reality__": Mental institution or human experimentation facility.
You are the test subject.

Visuals start off in "happy" style, but the more "marbles" you collect,
the more frequent certain objects reveal their true nature;
sprites randomly use the "real" version while in "happy" land;
at the end, the background changes to the "real" and evil surroundings.

### Visual Effects
on collect object: big title with object name of current state-of-reality;
happy: fun style; reality: evil style

### Objects
- "The Collector" (player character) : "The Patient" or "The Subject"
- "Marbles" : Brain Pieces (or Body Pieces?)  
    * Physics enabled?
- "Toys" : Body Pieces / your missing limbs?
    * optional collectables?
    * buffs player during escape-sequence the more collected?
        * buff player speed? jump strength?
- "Sack of Marbles"(?) (marble dropoff area) : machine holding "Your Brain"
- "Candy" : Medication / pills
- "Friends"/"Toys"/"Plushies" (enemies) : Doctors / Guards

### Gameplay Loop
Run around "Happy Fun Land" and find marbles to collect.
Bring your collected marbles back to a "hub"(?) area.
The more marbles collected, the more "reality" breaks through the facade.
Once all marbles are collected, you re-assemble them into a familiar structure.

### Goal
Collect all marbles/brain/body pieces and re-assemble your brain/body.
After collecting all pieces, and revealing reality, initiate
__escape sequence__: Run through the now-revealed reality and reach the exit
while doctors / guards chase and hunt you down.

### Detainment QTE
During escape-sequence, if doctor/guard catches you:
button mashing QTE to break free? maybe strength based on collected "Toys"/Limbs
